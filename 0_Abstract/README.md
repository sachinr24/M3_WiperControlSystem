## WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM

### INTRODUCTION

Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed
and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear
window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper
arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called
pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper.

Windshield wipers keep the windshield of a vehicle clear from rain water, snow, dust and road spray. The first windshield wipers were operated manually by moving a lever inside the car. Later wiper designs were powered by the engine's manifold vacuum. Virtually all wipers today employ an electric motor coupled with a linkage mechanism and are actuated by a knob beside the steering wheel. The wiper blade speed can be adjusted by the driver.

Modern windshield wipers may also be run intermittently. The intermittent wiper option cycles the wipers on and off every few seconds rather than running constantly. Intermittent control first appeared in automobiles in the 1970's. The original intermittent wipers were controlled by a constant power source that was routed through a series of switches. Now, virtually all automotive wipers are controlled by a microprocessor.

### OBJECTIVE

The aim of the project is to design a wiper control system which automatically controls the wiper according to the rain fall of water.In large cities and industries where supply and distribution tanks are at a largedistance from water control station, it is very difficult situation to monitor the water.

The main objective of this project is through ARM microcontroller to design a wiper control system. The project mainly insists on controlling the motion of wiper based on frequency and time period (in seconds).
